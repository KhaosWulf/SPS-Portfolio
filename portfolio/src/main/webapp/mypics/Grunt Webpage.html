<h1> The Unofficial, Official Child of the Great Commander Shepard</h1>
</div>
<h4>By: Charity Tarver<h4>
<h1>Tank-Born.</h1>

<p>Pure. Of DNA and of strength. Born enfolded into a world of blurred moving images and muffled voices. Cold. Infuriating. Virgo-inducing. Muscles ached and itched to leap onto what was barely seen as severely distured rubble. Destroyed terrain. Voices of strength whispered power to clogged ears. Power known in many names. Hmph. Perceived Power. Assumed Power. The voices... No, a voice. A voice who distorted in ranges of barely contained glee, arrogance, madness, and cowardice. The voice chorteled and made a resounding Thunk! on to the small abode which housed a creation so ready, READY to MOVE for it disturbed the restrained body within.</p>
<h1>Battered to Life.</h1>
<img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/9df9b9a031bfed33f10dae4d4d3f1821/tumblr_p530o4SgtF1uby4wto1_500.gif" alt="FirstMeeting" style="width:300px;height:200px">
<p>And yet before he could awake, his very existence hinged on the whimsy of one soldier. A whimsy that would see him with worth...Or floating in the coldness of space, never to fully comprehend his fate before he succumbed to it....And yet it turned to be in his favor, and one should expect gratitude. Gratitude for finally being able to expell the thick liquids in his throat, for synthetic air. Synthetic, but air. Yet his bulky form, finally MOVING, took charge to press the tiny thing before him into the bulkhead. He growled and glared and bared his teeth demanding information about himself of the alien. They supplied their name instead and...Oh? Well what do you know. The tiny thing, unflinching, managing to press a very deadly-looking gun into his gut... Heh heh heh... He like this human. Their name was Shepard, and he... he went through the useless names of power in his head. He hated all of them. All except the one the Voice despised. He backed off the human. They were Shepard...and he was Grunt.  </p>
<h1>Forced to Thrive.To Learn.</h1>

<p>Shepard was his leader. That was well enough, for they did not seem weak.In fact, they seemed quite caring. Blecgh, but not in a disgusting way. In a sensible way. He was pure Krogran, THE best of the best, but something was wrong. He itched and twiched. He paced and growled. He was not well. Without any solution in sight, he went to them, not expecting to be taken seriously. Yet...Shepard halted everything, to make sure they figured out the problem together. And so they went to his homeplanet, but not HIS home, Tuchanka. It was pathetic, a bunch of rubble and crap. Yet, it did prove to depict Shepard in a new light. They were good friends with the Clan Leader, who said he needed to earn being Krogan, to join a Clan.</p>
<p>The older clans despised the idea of him earning his right, and none would aid him. He needed a mentor, and guide, a BATTLEMASTER. Shepard stepped up and put them all in their places. HA! A human battlemaster putting "real" krogan to shame! He had never been so sure of his loyalty until right then. He had all he needed to succeed.</p>
<h1>To Succeed. To Earn His Rite of Passage.</h1>

<p>They came out victorious. Even when others tried to sabotage them, they pushed on. He put those idiots and Thresher Maws down like the maggots they were. And right by his side was his battlemaster. They were Krogan of Clan Urdnot.</p>

<p>He was now his own leader. Efficient. Experienced. Confident. A Berseker. Yet he would never be out from under his Battlemaster. And that was perfectly fine with him.</p>
