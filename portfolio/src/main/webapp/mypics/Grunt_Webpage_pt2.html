        <h4>By: Charity Tarver<h4>
            <p>My interest lies in cybernetic augmentation, specifically those that can be disguised or allowed as a necessity, such as the eyes for sight. Such can be displayed in the above images, representing a, though fictional, person (T-Bug in Cyberpunk) utilize the augmentations in her eyes to wirelessly, and while wired, hack into some other computer-based device. This interests me greatly, as I love wearable technology: big power packed into an inconspicuous object/frame. It could make a number of activities easier, especially considering I am interested in the military. I could not only enhance vision, but highlight important mission objectives, visually display a gps rout if i am lost, and have a HUD monitors my health, connected to other sensors on and around my body. I could even answer the phone in my head and see the display. And this could also increase life expectancy. And if it sounds like a video game, well of course, who wouldn't want that feeling and aethestic to their life. And it does not have to necessarily be the eye. I just like the concept.</p>
